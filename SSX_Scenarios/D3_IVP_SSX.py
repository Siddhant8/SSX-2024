"""D3_IVP_SSX.py

This is the *simplest* model we will consider for modeling spheromaks evolving in the SSX wind tunnel.

Major simplifications fall in two categories
lnrho = dist.Field(name = 'lnrho', bases = (xbasis, ybasis,))
Geometry
--------
We consider a square duct using real Fourier bases (sin/cos) in all directions.

Equations
---------
The equations themselves are those from Schaffner et al (2014), with the following simplifications

* hall term off
* constant eta instead of Spitzer
* no wall recycling term
* no mass diffusion

For this model, rather than kinematic viscosity nu and thermal
diffusivity chi varying with density rho as they should, we are here
holding them *constant*. This dramatically simplifies the form of the
equations in Dedalus.

We use the vector potential, and enforce the Coulomb Gauge, div(A) = 0.

File formerly called D3_SSX_A_2_spheromaks or similar
- when looking for older versions, check both current name and that name.

Currently working on solving T/rho unphysicalities.

Dedalus 3 edits made by Alex Skeldon and Siddhant Ranka. Direct all queries to askeldo1@swarthmore.edu or sranka1@swarthmore.edu.

To Do: Figure out how to install dedalus3 in jupyter notebook - ask Alex possibly
To Do: Run code with the value of beta I calculated
Why does beta suddenly spike up after 225 iterations to become greater than 1?
Why does the minimum alfvÃ©n time become negative after beta comes back down?
Try increasing the resolution even more or making the IC curve less steep
Code crashes when the temperature becomes negative - happens at 844 iterations - check why this happens
